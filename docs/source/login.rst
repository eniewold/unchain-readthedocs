This page explains the login procedure. Please refer to :doc:`register` if you want to create a new account.

The login page is located at <https://unchain.app/Login>.

======================
Web Application Login
======================

Please note that login page is only available on the web application using PC or laptop. Mobile app login requires an access code that can be generated on the web application.

Simply enter the username (nickname) you've used during registration together with the correct password to gain access to your portfolio data. 

.. note::
   Since we don't register any personal details, there is **no password recovery** available!

======================
Mobile App Login
======================

To access the mobile application, you will need to generate a mobile access code first. Please follow these steps:

* Login on the web application using desktop browser,
* Navigate to the 'Profile' page using the side menu,
* Activate the 'Session' tab shown on the page,
* Click on the 'New Mobile Session Code' button shown,
* Use the code shown to login on mobile.

When the mobile application is opened, the generated access code is requested. Enter the code in the login screen to access your account. 

.. note::
   The shown code is only valid for a limited amount of time.
   
======================
Revoke Access
======================

You can manage the access given to any session on the 'Sessions' tab of the 'Sessions' page. Simply click on the trash-can icon to revoke access to a session. 
The next time that session requests any data, it will be denied access to any data request.
