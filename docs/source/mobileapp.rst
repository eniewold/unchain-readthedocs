Mobile App
######################

Our mobile companion app is available through the Apple App Store, Google Play store and through apk side-loading. You can find all available entries using the mobile icon in the menu bar. 

It can also be used as a Progressive Web App and supports the 'Add to Home Screen' functionality of a modern browser. The mobile app always needs an internet connection. 

.. note::

   You can only sign in to the mobile app using a Mobile Access code; this can be quickly generated with the web application on PC or laptop. See :doc:`login` for more details.

The mobile app includes a sub-set of functionality from the web application. The following pages are implemented:

* Portfolio
* Transactions
* Charts
* Favorites
* Uploads
* Notifications
* Connections
* Preferences
* Subscriptions
* Account (Profile)

When data is shown in a table format, not all column might be shown due to limited space on a mobile device. You can rotate your device to show more column or touch the first item in a row to display the hidden data. 

======================

======================

Much like the :doc:`portfolio` page, with a limited selection of columns. The screen is updated automatically every minute with the latest prices. 

======================
Transactions
======================

Shows the newest transactions that were synchronized. Scroll down to load additional transactions. 

======================
