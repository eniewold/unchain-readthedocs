Some blockchains are monitored by our components for changes when blocks are mined. All addresses in an transaction are recorded; and when the transaction is used by a Connection, that connection will :doc:`connections:jump-queue`. 

The following blockchains are currently supported by real-time processing:

* :ref:`blockchains:ethereum` (native and tokens)
* :ref:`blockchains:bitcoin` (native)
* :ref:`blockchains:binance-smart-chain` (native currency only)
