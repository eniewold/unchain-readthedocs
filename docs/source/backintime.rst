Back in Time
######################

The 'Back in Time' function is available through the filter icon in the lower right bottom corner. The button will show a slide-out window with a :doc:`backintime` header and a :doc:`selections` header.

Once opened, use the date field to select a specific date or use the year drop-down to select the start of a year. When selected, all data shown is limited as it was the selected date. Effectively, you see all transactions and prices at the selected point in time. 

.. only:: html

The following web application pages have support for this functionality where the displayed data will be altered to represent the selected date: 

* :doc:`dashboard`
* :doc:`portfolio`
* :doc:`assets`
* :doc:`transactions`
* :doc:`trades`

Only for the above mentioned page the filter icon will be available. All other pages will ignore any selected date. 

.. note::

   When a date is selected; it remains active throughout the application; the filter icon denotes the active date filter by an additional icon.
