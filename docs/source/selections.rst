The 'Selections' function is available through the filter icon in the lower right bottom corner. The button will show a slide-out window with a :doc:`backintime` header and a :doc:`selections` header.

In this slide-out window you can activate the Selections functionality by toggling check-box 'Use Selections'. This will also enable additional interface elements below.

    .. image:: images/selections_showinterface.gif

All connections are shown and can be selected separately by using the check-box next to the connection name. When selected; all data shown is filtered to represent the selection. 

With the 'Select All' and 'Invert' buttons you can quickly filter the data to the desired set of connections. 

The following pages have support for this functionality where the displayed data will be altered to represent the selected date: 

* :doc:`dashboard`
* :doc:`portfolio`
* :doc:`assets`
* :doc:`transactions`
* :doc:`trades`

.. note::

    Note that the selection can also be applied to the mobile application, if activated on the mobile app. Changing a selection on mobile app is done through the connections page.
