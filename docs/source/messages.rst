The 'Messages' page gives access to the internal messaging functionality. Messages can be send and received between other users of the application. 

Most :doc:`support` questions are also handled through this page. You can send a message to our support team by using the 'Contact Support' button. 

.. note::
  Due to mobile app store restriction, direct messages are not available in the mobile app.

======================
View Conversations
======================

All current and previous conversations are displayed under the 'Conversations' section. You see the recipient and title of each conversation listed and click on it to display the content. By using the small array, you can archive (or unarchive) a conversation. 

You can type a reply next to the 'Reply' field, analog to most modern direct messaging applications. Use the 'Send' button or press Enter key to transmit the response. 

You can also share an image by using the 'Image Upload' button. This will send an image without caption, so make sure to also place a reply before or after the upload. Upload size has a generous limit. 

.. note::
    Messages (and images) in a conversation are kept for 90 days, read or unread. Archived conversions are completely removed after 30 days. 

======================
New Conversation
======================

Use the 'New Conversation' button to start a new conversation with another application user. You will be requested to enter an existing username and a subject. The system will check if the username entered actually exists. 

You will also need to set an subject for the conversation. Don't be to generic when creating a new support conversation. Newly created conversations might be added to the bottom of the list of conversation; please scroll down if needed. 

For ongoing conversations, you can update the subject. Just alter the shown subject and use the 'Update subject' button afterwards.
