To register as a new user please visit the <https://unchain.app/Register> page. You can also use the `Create Account` button on the home page <https://unchain.app>.

.. note::
    Please note that a new account can only be registered using the (desktop) web application on a PC or laptop. The mobile app does **not** have a new account registration option.

======================
Username / Nickname
======================

Please use a username (nickname) for the new account. Although you can use your email address, we recommend you use an login alias for anonymous usage of our system. The entered username must be unique on our system, you will be warned if there is a conflict. 

======================
Password
======================

Enter the password you wish to use for the account, twice. We have no password strength requirements, although we recommend you choose an unique and strong password to prevent unauthorized access. If you choose an anonymous alias as Username, any compromised details will not be relatable to your person. 

.. note::
  There is no password recovery procedure, since we don't register any personal details like an email address. Please make a (mental) note of this.
