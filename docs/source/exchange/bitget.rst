* Select 'API Management' from the drop-down menu
* Click the 'Create API' button and enter the fields as followed:
* Note: "unchain.app"
* Passphrase (API token): Make-up your own unique key here. Don't re-use a password; just create a unique string for this API key only. Enter this string into the "Passphrase" field of the unchain.app new connection dialog.
* Permissions: "Read only" as only selected item
* Provide requested email code and 2FA code
* Click on the 'Next' button to generate the codes.

* Copy the shown 'Secret key' character string into the 'Secret' property field (on unchain.app)

.. note::

   Since this Exchange API requires a query for each trading pair, synchronization of all transactions might take a couple of minutes.
   Only 'Spot' wallet transactions (fill orders, deposists and withdrawals) are synchronized.
