NEXO App
######################

The NEXO App does not have an automatic API interface to connect to. In stead, you need to export (CSV) files from the app and upload these to our application. You can find the upload function in the 'Uploads' page of our application. The instructions below are for the NEXO App, exporting CSV files:

* Login into web app or mobile app
* [Web App] Go to the 'Transactions' tab in web app or
* [Mobile App] Navigate to the 'Wallet' tab and select the transaction icon in upper corner
* Filter the transaction (don't filter for first import)
* Export to CSV (click the CSV / Export icon / button)

Comments:
-------------------------
* No filters are applied by default, so to prevent processing all transactions every time, check filter a limited set for faster processing.
* In the mobile app, the app will try to open a CSV app after download; feel free to cancal this action and switch to unchain.app after download.
* In the mobile app, when selecting the file to upload, you might need to use a file manager to find the just exported and downloaded file.

.. note::

   Although the NEXO App is often referred to as a 'Wallet', the app is actually considered an Exchange; Your assets are custodial (not your keys) and you are allowed to swap your assets to a number of other types determined by the provider.
