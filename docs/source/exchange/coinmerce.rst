######################

The Coinmerce web application does not have an API for automatic transaction synchronization, use the following instructions to export a file with your transactions:

* Log in web app as usual
* Open the 'Orders' tab using top menu entry.
* Select the 'Export' link
* The CSV file will be downloaded automatically.
* The file is usually called 'orders.csv'

The downloaded file can be found in your downloads folder and can be uploaded into the unchain.app immediately. 

.. note::

   The 'Coinmerce Coin' (symbol CM) is imported as EUR denomination, since it is a 1-to-1 conversion when using fiat on the Coinmerce platform.
